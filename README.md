# Video platform project

## **About the project**
    Its a simple video platform which shows few simple videos from local source.
    Main parts are authentication, video preview and comment section.

## **Purpose of the project**
    This project was actually a test/challenge project which a company requested me to do for their recruitment process.
    I decided to make it public as it does not contain any private data or code.
    I may improve it regularly.
